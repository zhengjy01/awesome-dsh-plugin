English | [中文](README.zh.md)

> A curated list of plugins for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`).

DeepSeek Harness is DeepSeek's open-source agent harness — a runnable coding agent (Web and headless), built on a framework where everything is a plugin: models, tools, sandboxes, session storage, UI, even the agent loop itself. Plugins can extend the official coding agent, swap out its core parts, or assemble something entirely different.

This list collects community plugins that are installable via `dsh plugin add` (each declares a `dsh.bundle` manifest). [PRs welcome](#contributing).

> 🛒 **Recommended: [dsh-market](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market#readme)** (optional) — the plugin market inside DeepSeek Harness, with every plugin on this list. Simple, friendly UI: one-click plugin install and upgrade, one-click theme switching:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dshmarket
```

> 💡 Prefer chat? [dsh-find-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/dsh-find-plugin#readme) lets your agent find plugins for you (`dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-find-plugin`).

> [!WARNING]
> Installing a plugin runs third-party code on your machine with your own permissions — it can read your files, use your credentials, and reach the network. Tool approvals don't sandbox plugin code. Being on this list is not a security review: check the source before you install, and try unfamiliar plugins somewhere that doesn't hold your keys. See the full disclaimer at the bottom of this page.
